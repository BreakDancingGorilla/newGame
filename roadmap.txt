heck yeah—survival games are a playground for systems. here’s a tight menu of features you can mix-and-match, plus a build order so you don’t drown in scope.

# core survival loop (mvp)

* player stats: health, stamina, hunger, thirst, body temp
* damage types: physical, bleed, poison, cold/heat
* time system: day/night cycle; nights are riskier
* resources: wood, stone, ore, fiber, food, water
* tools: axe, pickaxe, knife (with durability)
* crafting: campfire, basic tools, bandages, simple weapons
* shelter: place walls/floors/doors; bed for respawn
* enemies: 1–2 basic melee types with patrol/aggro + simple pathing
* save/load: autosave on sleep or checkpoints

# progression & systems

* tech tiers: primitive → metal → advanced (gates via rare mats + benches)
* skill/perk tree: harvesting speed, carry weight, crit chance, crafting speed
* blueprint drops: rare recipes from dungeons/bosses
* weather: rain (cold/wet), snow (hypothermia), storm (visibility), heat (dehydration)
* seasons: crop growth, animal spawns, clothing requirements
* farming: seeds, soil quality, watering, pests; compost → fertilizer
* cooking: raw → cooked → gourmet (buffs), food spoilage
* electricity/fuel: generators, solar, batteries, wiring (lights/turrets)
* traps & defenses: spikes, snares, mines, auto-turrets
* vehicles/mounts: hand cart → raft → boat → glider → buggy (fuel + repairs)

# world & content

* biomes: meadow, forest, swamp, desert, mountain, caves (unique threats & loot)
* POIs: ruins, labs, bunkers, crashed pods with mini-puzzles/keys
* events: blood moon, supply drops, roaming horde, merchant caravan
* bosses: biome guardians unlock fast travel/recipes
* quests/contracts: “hunt X”, “deliver Y”, “defend Z minutes”

# enemies & ai

* archetypes: charger, ranged spitter, burrower/ambusher, tank, swarmer
* senses: sight, sound, smell; distraction (rocks/alarms)
* behaviors: patrol → investigate → chase → search → give up
* nests/hives: destroy to reduce local spawn pressure

# building & base life

* snapping grid, upgrade/repair hammer, decay/tax if unsupported
* storage with tags/auto-sort; lockable doors/keys
* beds (spawn), wardrobes (temperature/armor sets)
* crafting stations: workbench, smelter, chemistry, fabricator
* power network: cables, switches, fuses; power usage UI

# economy & loot

* rarity tiers; dismantle to mats
* merchants: barter with reputation; daily rotating stock
* currency (or cigarettes/scrap) + craft insurance (keep item on death)

# multiplayer (if you go there)

* drop-in co-op; shared beds & chests; roles (builder/scout/medic)
* base permissions; proximity voice; `/ping` markers
* anti-grief options: claim flags, raid windows, PvE/PvP servers

# UX & quality of life

* map & fog of war; custom markers
* compass & waypoints; mini-quest tracker
* radial menu for build/craft; quick slots; stack split; shift-click
* damage numbers toggles; hit flashes; status effect icons with timers
* accessibility: colorblind-safe palettes, full remap, aim assist, subtitles

# tech for your current engine (canvas-based)

* entity component system (ECS) lite: entities + components (Transform, Sprite, Collider, Health) + systems (Render, Physics, AI)
* spatial partitioning: uniform grid or quad-tree for collision; huge perf win over O(n²)
* swept AABB for fast movers; continuous collision to prevent tunneling
* object pools for projectiles/particles/enemies (no GC spikes)
* animation: sprite sheets (you’ve got this), add time-based frame advance (ms)
* audio: SFX pools, 2D positional pan; low-latency `AudioContext`
* debug overlay: fps, draw calls, active entities, heap estimate
* save format: JSON snapshot of components; version it

# difficulty & pacing

* director system: raises/lower danger based on your gear, base strength, recent deaths
* heatmap spawns: “noisy” players attract threats
* wave/horde nights: scaling frequency + composition
* soft caps: food/water decay faster the more you hoard (optional)

# roadmap (pragmatic build order)

1. **MVP**: stats + day/night + 1 biome + 1 enemy + basic crafting + shelter + save/load
2. **Alpha**: farming + cooking + 3–4 enemies + weather + 2 POIs + talent perks
3. **Beta**: base power + traps + horde nights + boss + 2 more biomes + merchants
4. **Polish**: particles, camera shake, hit pause, soundscape, achievements, accessibility

# quick wins you can add this week

* stamina that gates sprint/roll; regen slower when hungry/thirsty
* blood moon event every 5 nights (increasing wave size)
* simple trap: placeable spike that damages + slows enemies
* campfire with radial cooking UI (raw → cooked; small buff)
* map markers + compass headings
* quad-tree or grid buckets for your current collision checks

Want me to turn any of these into concrete tasks + starter code (e.g., stamina system, weather tick, or grid-based collision)?
